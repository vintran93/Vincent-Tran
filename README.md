Hey! I'm Vincent! üòÉ

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an experienced Full Stack Software Developer in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React Redux. I have a healthcare and insurance background, strong interpersonal skills, and a knack for problem solving. 

I highly value clients and customers' needs and strive to create products that they will be beneficial to our society. I am a curious and natural problem solver and always want to keep learning and improving my skillset. I am amicable and always trying to be positive and ensure the company is meeting its goals and expectations all while staying up to date and innovative.

If I am not coding, I am still learning new things and staying busy in other hobbies such as playing piano or learning a new trick on a skateboard.
